Thinking back there was always something that I wrote in my head while I was excited about that new project I was working on. This blog was created to channel that feeling into something productive and useful. With the accelerated standards process and the fact that compilers are finally catching up to it very fast, currently Iâ€™m very focused on C++ and intend to stay on top of the new advancements, making this the main focus of the blog.

The posts on this blog do not represent the views of any present, past or future employers of mine. I try my best to be factually correct, but no guarantees in this regard. If you do find an error, please leave a comment so I can fix it!
