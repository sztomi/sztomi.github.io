C++ has some language constructs that are rarely seen in use. These constructs have their own, valid uses, but should be used sparingly. As the now adage-status quote from [The Old New Thing](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/06/2036150.aspx) says:

<p class="message">
Code is read much more often than it is written, so plan accordingly
</p>

In this series we will take a look at different instances of unusual C++ language constructs, shortly explaining their use-cases, syntax and pitfalls.

UPDATE: the series was moved to Dr. Dobbs! The rewritten, expanded first part is available [here](http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/understanding-c-function-try-blocks/240168262).
