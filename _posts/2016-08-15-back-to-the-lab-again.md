After unexpectedly losing the contents of my VPS, I recovered the scraps of my blog from the
Wayback machine. I deleted one post, which had a larger amount of screenshots that I had no desire
to recreate (and the post wasn't so good anyway).

Anyway, the blog is here again, hopefully Google forgives the downtime. I made sure to use the old
links and put extra effort into having the old comments in place.

The blog now runs on Github pages and is based on Jekyll. You can find the source [here](https://github.com/sztomi/sztomi.github.io).

Regarding my VPS service provider: let's just say, I won't be recommending that company to anyone, anytime soon.
