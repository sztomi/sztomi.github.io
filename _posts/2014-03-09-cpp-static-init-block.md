## This is a placeholder while I recover the content

Hi! I've lost the contents of the VPS I used to run my blog previously. I'm in the process of
recovering the site. You can use the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20160310013921/http://szelei.me/) in the meantime to see the old content.
