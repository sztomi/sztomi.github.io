My friend wrote a novel. As one of the early readers and critics, I'm immensely proud of her and grateful to have been a part of this journey. It is written in Hungarian, but who knows, maybe a translation is coming in the future. The book is about to be printed soon and will be available in the largest Hungarian bookstores (an amazing achievement on its own).
